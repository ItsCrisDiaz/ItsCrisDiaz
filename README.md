## 🐙 About me 

I'm a Frontend Developer with 1+ years of experience, with emphasis in creating accessible experience.

I love Web accessibility, I find fascinating the multiple ways a person can navigate throught a site and after I understood that, I decided to focus my career in creating a web where **everyone** can be a part of it.

Currently working at [Books and Books Ltda](https://www.booksandbooks.com.co/) as a Frontend Developer.
